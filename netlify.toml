  # Base directory - Netlify will cd into this directory before building
  base = "apps/web"
  
  # Build command - ensure dependencies are installed first
  command = "npm install && npm run build"
  
  # Publish directory (relative to base directory)
  # For static export, Next.js outputs to 'out' directory
  publish = "out"

# No Next.js plugin needed for static export
# Static export doesn't require server-side rendering
