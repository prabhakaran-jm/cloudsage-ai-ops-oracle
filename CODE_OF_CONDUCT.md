This project follows the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) Code of Conduct (v2.1).

## Our Pledge
I pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socioeconomic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Standards
- Use welcoming and inclusive language.
- Be respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences.
- Gracefully accept constructive criticism.
- Focus on what is best for the community.
- Show empathy towards other community members.

Unacceptable behavior includes harassment, trolling, derogatory comments, public or private harassment, publishing others’ private information without permission, and other conduct reasonably considered inappropriate.
